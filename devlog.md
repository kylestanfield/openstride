Made some progress on the layout design . Following the expo tutorial but adapting it to my own purpose.

TODO:

1. Make the recording button have React state, change the component based on a recording toggle.

2. Get some work in tracking gps started

3. Investigate adding gesture support , perhaps adding a swipe gesture to move between pages, and some animation for changing pages via swipe. Use the libraries described at https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/gestures/

4. Continue working on colors / theming etc
